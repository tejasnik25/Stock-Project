This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Optional Environment variables for Vision validation

The project supports optional AI vision integration to validate uploaded images more reliably. Configure one of the following environment variables to enable model-based image validation:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — If set, the server will attempt to call the OpenAI Responses API to classify images as trading charts.
- `VISION_API_KEY` — Alternate key for other vision providers.

If neither key is set, the server uses heuristic checks (image MIME type and dimensions) as a fallback.
